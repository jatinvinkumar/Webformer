## Pipeline

### Preinstallation
First, prepare a **Python3** environment, and run the following commands:
```
  git clone https://github.com/xrr233/Webformer.git Webformer
  cd Webformer
  pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

pip3 install torch --pre --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu116

### Prepare the Corpus Data
Every piece of corpus data is the raw HTML code of a web page.
Run the following commands to clear irrelevant content and get the training corpus:
```
  python Preprocess/html2json.py 
```
Remember to set your data path in the code.

### Prepare the Training Data
Use the json file output in the previous step to generate training data.
```
  bash construct_data.sh
```

### Running Pre-training

```
 bash train.sh
```
